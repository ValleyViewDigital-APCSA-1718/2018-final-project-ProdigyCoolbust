“Dino Trouble” will be a simple one player runner game with the objective being to stay alive as long as possible and to obtain the largest score. The distance will be represented by the score and a single player will attempt to beat previously set scores in the game file. As the player plays the game, the speed of the game increases to an incredible difficulty and this added mechanic makes the game unique and adds replay factor. The game will not include artificial intelligence( yet further down in development artificial intelligence can be added to improve testing at later game stages) however it will feature an enemy like object class derived from a singular enemy interface, that the player must avoid in order to continue playing the game. The enemy class will spawn at a similar, yet slightly varying location and will move towards the player. Another possible addition would be to implement a start menu and a system to store users initials and display them along with their score for a more personalized experience.

Goal: Obtiain the highest score possible. Avoid the cacti.
